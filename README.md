# Wireless-Sensor-Network-System-Design-Based-on-Arduino-and-ZigBee-to-Detect-Illegal-Logging
This repository contains the packages for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) system design based on Arduino and ZigBee with Python Language

**Abstract**
Illegal-logging is a serious problem that occurred in Indonesia and only few realized about it. However, the government has already work so hard to overcome the problem. About 51% of Indonesia’s land area is forest area, it is conceivable the shortage of human resources to protect forest that vast for 24 hours a day.

Along with the development of information technology, comes the wireless sensor network system. The system is a group of sensors that work together so they create a network and connected wirelessly. With that kind of system, there is a chance to substitute human resources as the watchers of the forest. Not quite up there, smart system is required to cover human’s logic to make decisions or actions. Smart system works as early warning system which can shows the warning and takes decision when meet the conditions.

The objective of this research is to design a wireless sensor network that can be used to monitor sound, especially the sound of illegal-logging with chainsaw. Then the system’s prototype is supposed to give real-time information to the coordinator and then make decisions against each warnings.
